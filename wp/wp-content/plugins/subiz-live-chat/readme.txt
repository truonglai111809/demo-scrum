Install Subiz live chat plugin and provide instant support for visitors to your website!

== Description ==

Driving traffic to your website is hard. Making them stay is even harder. Your products may outstanding, your web design may be well designed. But in fact, people are opting out of your site just because your instant support is nowhere to be found. Like any brick-and-mortar store, an online shop can barely function well without a virtual real-time salesman. It’s not the kind who stay behind the e-mailbox and takes hours to respond. Nor the man who can only be reached after wading through those infuriating automated phone trees. It must be a live chat agent, who can satisfy customers' needs in a jiffy.

[Subiz](http://subiz.com/?utm_source=plugin_wp&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=plugin_wp1.1) offers a professional customer interaction channel where sales and customer service reps are able to proactively engage with visitors, provide live support, places a huge impact on their buying decision and boost sales.
All of these interactions occur on a live chat widget, running in real-time while visitor are exploring the page.
This powerful live chat plugin will turn your website visitor into paying customers, increase conversion rates, and generate more loyalty customers.
